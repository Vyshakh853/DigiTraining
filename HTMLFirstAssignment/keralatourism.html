							<h3>History</h3>
							<p class="description">The history of Keralam, India, dates back many millennia. Stone age carvings in the Edakkal Caves feature pictorial writings believed to date to at least the Neolithic era around 5,000 BC, indicating the presence of a prehistoric civilisation or settlement in this region. From as early as 3000 BC, Kerala had established itself as a major spice trade centre. Keralam had direct contact across the Arabian Sea with all the major Mediterranean and Red Sea ports as well those of the Far East. The spice trade between Keralam and much of the world was one of the main drivers of the world economy. For much of history, ports in Keralam were the busiest (Muziris) among all trade and travel routes in the history of the world.</p>
